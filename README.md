# Formo

A form helper and validator for React JS

Formo is under heavy developments, it should be ready before the end of this year.

Why formo, why another library ?

* avoid boilerplat
* manage patterns
* manage required fields
* schema declaration, but keep validation and schema management isolated from rendering
* offer to build component from many schema attributes
* show error as soon as possible (onChange)
* manage form dynamicity
* manage errors from server (inline and after submit)
